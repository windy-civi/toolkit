This Substitute exempts, for purposes of this Act, nonprofit organizations, schools, early childhood centers, health care facilities, facilities operated by the Department of Children, Youth, and Their Families, and Level IV and Level V Department of Correction facilities from the definition of \u201cfood establishment.\u201d The penalty provisions of this Act are effective 2 years after enactment.\r\nThis Substitute includes language to clarify that \u201csingle-use food service items\u201d do not include items used to contain or secure food or beverages that are delivered, picked up, or taken to go from a food establishment, such as cups, boxes, sandwich picks, wrappers, and bags. Also for clarity and to address confusion arising out of House Substitute No. 1 to House Bill No. 111, this Substitute does not include an unchanged subsection of existing code that is unaffected by and does not affect the provisions of this Act."
