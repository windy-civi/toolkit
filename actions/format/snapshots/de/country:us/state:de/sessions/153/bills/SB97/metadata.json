      "abstract": "This Act continues the practice of amending periodically the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (\u201cLP Act\u201d) to keep it current and to maintain its national preeminence. The following is a section-by-section review of proposed amendments to the LP Act.\r\n\r\nSection 1 amends \u00a7 17-104(e) of the LP Act, which addresses certain duties of a registered agent of a limited partnership. Amended \u00a7 17-104(e) specifies that a registered agent may not perform its duties or functions solely through the use of a virtual office, the retention by the agent of a mail forwarding service, or both. Amended \u00a7 17-104(e) defines \u201cvirtual office\u201d as the performance of duties or functions solely through the internet or solely through other means of remote communication.\r\n\r\nSection 2 amends \u00a7 17-106(e) of the LP Act to provide that \u00a7 17-106(e) applies to ratification or waiver of a void or voidable act or transaction by any partner or other person in respect of a limited partnership, in addition to acts or transactions by a limited partnership. This Section also amends \u00a7 17-106(e) to provide that ratification or waiver pursuant to \u00a7 17-106(e) may be express or implied, including by the statements, action, inaction, or acquiescence of or by partners or other persons. Further, this Section amends \u00a7 17-106(e) to clarify that in a circumstance in which \u00a7 17-106(e) requires notice of the ratification or waiver to be given, the giving of the notice is not a condition to the effectiveness of the ratification or waiver. The amendments to \u00a7 17-106(e) in this Section are intended to provide rules different from the rules applied in existing case law that \u00a7 18-106(e) of the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, which is the same in all material respects as \u00a7 17-106(e), is limited to ratification or waiver of a limited liability company\u2019s own acts and transactions and that \u00a7 18-106(e) of the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act does not apply to ratification or waiver by conduct.\r\n\r\nSection 3 amends \u00a7 17-109(a) of the LP Act to provide that serving as a general partner of a limited partnership or as a liquidating trustee of a dissolved limited partnership is sufficient (without any requirement for execution by such person of the certificate of limited partnership) to (i) constitute such person\u2019s consent to the appointment of the registered agent of the limited partnership (or, if there is none, the Secretary of State) as such person\u2019s agent upon whom service of process may be made, and (ii) signify the consent of such general partner or liquidating trustee that any process when so served shall be of the same legal force and validity as if served upon such general partner or liquidating trustee within the State of Delaware.\r\n\r\nSection 4 amends \u00a7 17-202(f) of the LP Act to provide that at any time a person who is not shown as a general partner on the certificate of limited partnership of a dissolved limited partnership is winding up the limited partnership\u2019s affairs, the certificate of limited partnership shall be amended to add the name and business, residence or mailing address of each liquidating trustee unless the limited partners are the liquidating trustees, in which case the certificate of limited partnership shall be amended to state that the limited partners are winding up the limited partnership\u2019s affairs. This Section also amends \u00a7 17-202 of the LP Act to add a new \u00a7 17-202(g) to provide that at any time a person who is not shown as a general partner associated with a registered series on the certificate of registered series of a dissolved registered series is winding up the registered series\u2019 affairs, the certificate of registered series shall be amended to add the name and business, residence or mailing address of each liquidating trustee of the registered series unless the limited partners associated with the registered series are the liquidating trustees, in which case the certificate of registered series shall be amended to state that the limited partners associated with the registered series are winding up the registered series\u2019 affairs.\r\n\r\nSection 5 amends \u00a7 17-203(b) of the LP Act to confirm that, in addition to correcting a certificate of cancellation, a certificate of correction may nullify a certificate of cancellation.\r\n\r\nSection 6 amends \u00a7 17-204(a)(3) of the LP Act to delete language addressing who signs a certificate of cancellation when the general partners are not winding up a dissolved limited partnership\u2019s affairs because that is now addressed in the new \u00a7 17-204(e) of the LP Act. This Section also amends \u00a7 17-204(a)(12) of the LP Act to delete language addressing who signs a certificate of cancellation of certificate of registered series when the general partners associated with such series are not winding up the dissolved registered series\u2019 affairs because that is now addressed at new \u00a7 17-204(e) of the LP Act. This Section further amends \u00a7 17-204 of the LP Act to add a new \u00a717-204(e). New \u00a7 17-204(e) provides who signs certificates required by the LP Act to be signed by one or more general partners of a dissolved limited partnership when a person not shown on the certificate of limited partnership as a general partner of the limited partnership is winding up the affairs of the limited partnership. New \u00a7 17-204(e) also provides who signs certificates required by the LP Act to be signed by one or more general partners associated with a dissolved registered series when a person not shown on the certificate of registered series as a general partner associated with the registered series is winding up the affairs of the registered series.\r\n\r\nSection 7 amends \u00a7 17-211(c) of the LP Act to provide that a certificate of limited partnership must be attached to a certificate of consolidation for a consolidation in which the resulting entity from such consolidation is a domestic limited partnership.\r\n\r\nSection 8 amends \u00a7 17-213(a) of the LP Act, which provides for the correction of certificates filed with the Secretary of State. The amendment confirms that, in addition to correcting a previously filed certificate, a certificate of correction may nullify a previously filed certificate by specifying the inaccuracy or defect with respect to such previously filed certificate and providing that the previously filed certificate is nullified. Such a provision is sufficient if it states that the previously filed certificate is nullified or void or uses words of similar meaning.\r\n\r\nSection 9 amends \u00a7 17-302(f) of the LP Act to confirm that a partnership agreement may be amended in connection with a division of a limited partnership and a merger of registered series of a limited partnership, as is specifically contemplated by \u00a7\u00a7 17-220(f) and 17-224(e) of the LP Act, respectively.\r\n\r\nSection 10 amends \u00a7 17-902(1) of the LP Act to provide that an application for registration as a foreign limited partnership shall be executed by any person authorized to execute the application on behalf of the foreign limited partnership (which may or may not be a general partner of the foreign limited partnership).\r\n\r\nSection 11 amends \u00a7 17-905 of the LP Act to provide that a certificate correcting an inaccurate application for registration as a foreign limited partnership shall be executed by any person authorized to execute the certificate on behalf of the foreign limited partnership (which may or may not be a general partner of the foreign limited partnership).\r\n\r\nSection 12 amends \u00a7 17-906 of the LP Act to provide that a certificate of cancellation of registration as a foreign limited partnership shall be executed by any person authorized to execute the certificate on behalf of the foreign limited partnership (which may or may not be a general partner of the foreign limited partnership).\r\n\r\nSection 13 amends \u00a7 17-1109(b) of the LP Act to confirm that when the existence of a domestic limited partnership or registered series, or the registration of a foreign limited partnership, will cease by the filing of a certificate under the LP Act, the full amount of the annual tax for the calendar year in which such certificate becomes effective is due and payable prior to the filing of such certificate.\r\n\r\nSection 14 provides that the amendments to the LP Act take effect on August 1, 2025."
