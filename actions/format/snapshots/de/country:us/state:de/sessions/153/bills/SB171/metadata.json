      "abstract": "This Act amends the Town of Houston (\u201cTown\u201d) Charter to do all of the following:\r\n1. Gender neutralize the Charter.\r\n2. Clarify the voting rights for multiple owners of a single piece of real estate located in the Town.\r\n3. Change the times for polling and elections.\r\n4. Change the qualifications of Town Councilmembers, the Town Secretary, Assistant Secretary, Alderman, Assistant Alderman, Treasurer, Town Tax Collector, and Town Solicitor.\r\n5. Change the dates on which nominations for Town Councilmembers can be made.\r\n6. Clarify when Town Council meetings may be held and the date when Town Councilmembers can be sworn into office.\r\n7. Change the type of contracts that the Town Council may enter into.\r\n8. Change and clarify how Town taxes may be levied and collected.\r\n9. Change how the Town budget must be posted.\r\n10. Remove the regulation and control of observance of the Sabbath Day.\r\n11. Change the Town\u2019s right to regulate animals, beasts, birds, or fowl.\r\n12. Increase the Town\u2019s ability to levy fines. \r\n13. Remove limits on the amount of revenue the Town may raise.\r\n14. Clarify the utilities the Town may tax.\r\n15. Increase the borrowing limits of the Town.\r\n16. Give the Town greater flexibility to locate a bank to serve the Town. \r\n17. Change the voting rights in special elections. \r\n18. Corrects citations to the Delaware Code.\r\n\r\nThis Act makes technical corrections to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual. This Act also incorporates previously enacted changes [64 Del. Laws c. 211] that were inadvertently not included in the online copy of the Town of Houston\u2019s Charter. \r\n\r\nThis Act requires a greater than majority vote for passage because \u00a7 1 of Article IX of the Delaware Constitution requires the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members elected to each house of the General Assembly to amend a municipal charter."
