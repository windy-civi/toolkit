      "abstract": "This Act amends Delaware\u2019s marriage laws to recognize a valid marriage between first cousins obtained or recognized outside of Delaware (either in another state or territory of the United States or foreign country) as a valid and legal marriage in Delaware. This Act does not legalize the performance of marriages between first cousins within the State of Delaware. \r\nU.S. Immigration Services only recognizes marriages for immigrating couples as \u201cvalid\u201d if the marriage is valid both where the marriage was performed and in the state where the couple is currently living or planning to live. Couples planning to settle in Delaware have been advised by federal officials to move to neighboring states that recognize marriages between first cousins as legal, leading to loss of economic activity to the state and unnecessary financial hardships for families seeking legal reunification. \r\nThis substitute bill makes a technical correction and removes subsections of the Code that are unchanged."
