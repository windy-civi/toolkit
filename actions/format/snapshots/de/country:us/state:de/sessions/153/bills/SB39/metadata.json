      "abstract": "This Act amends the Charter of the Town of Selbyville (Selbyville) by doing all of the following:\r\n1. Divides Selbyville into 4 election districts. The 4 election districts must be nearly equal in population based on the most recent federal decennial census.\r\n2. Changes the composition of the Town Council so that the 4 members are comprised of 1 member from each district. Each member must be nominated and elected by the registered voters of the district in which the member resides.\r\n3. Requires that a candidate for Mayor or the Town Council be a resident of Selbyville for at least 2 years.\r\n4. Makes corresponding revisions to the staggered terms served by members of the Town Council.\r\n\r\nThis Act also makes technical corrections to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual.\r\n\r\nThis Act requires a greater than majority vote for passage because \u00a7 1 of Article IX of the Delaware Constitution requires the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members elected to each house of the General Assembly to amend a charter issued to a municipal corporation."
