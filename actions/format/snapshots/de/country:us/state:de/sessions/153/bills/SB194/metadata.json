      "abstract": "This Act establishes worker protections for employees who work in a warehouse distribution center. This Act requires employers to provide each employee with a written description of any quota the employee may be subject to during their scope of employment. This Act prohibits an employer from requiring an employee to meet a quota that would prevent the employee from being able to have meal and rest periods as required by Department of Labor standards. Adverse action may not be taken against an employee by an employer for failure to meet a quota that does not allow for meal and rest periods. \r\nThe Act permits an employee to request a written description when they believe a quota prohibited them from receiving appropriate meal or rest periods. Any discriminatory or retaliatory action taken against an employee within 90 days of the employee making a written request or complaint creates a rebuttable presumption of retaliation by the employer. The Act establishes the Secretary of Labor\u2019s authority to enforce and pass regulations to effectuate this Act, including remedies and relief available to the Department of Labor."
