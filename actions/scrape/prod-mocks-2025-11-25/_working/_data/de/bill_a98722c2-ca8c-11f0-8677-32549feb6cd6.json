The non-residential rate must be at least as great as the residential rate and may be no more than twice the residential rate. The school district must set both rates so that it is not realizing any more revenue than it was authorized to collect by law if it were using a single tax rate.\r\nThis Act also makes a change to the additional amount a school board may approve to the tax rate to account for delinquencies and costs of collection. Under current law a school board is required to add 10% to its authorized tax rate for delinquencies and costs of collection. This Act allows, but does not require, a school board to add up to 10% to its tax rate for delinquencies and costs of collection.\r\nTechnical corrections are also made to align these sections with the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced and Assigned to Education Committee in House", "date": "2025-08-07", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Education", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Kimberly Williams", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Kimberly Williams\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "John \"Jack\" Walsh", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"John \\\"Jack\\\" Walsh\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Ray Seigfried", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Ray Seigfried\"}", "organization_id": null}], "related_bills": [], "versions": [{"note": "Bill Text", "links": [{"url": "https://legis.delaware.gov/json/BillDetail/GenerateHtmlDocument?legislationId=142678&legislationTypeId=1&docTypeId=2&legislationName=HB243", "media_type": "text/html"}, {"url": "https://legis.delaware.gov/json/BillDetail/GeneratePdfDocument?legislationId=142678&legislationTypeId=1&docTypeId=2&legislationName=HB243", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}], "documents": [], "citations": [], "sources": [{"url": "https://legis.delaware.gov/BillDetail?LegislationId=142678", "note": "text/html"}], "extras": {}, "jurisdiction": {"id": "ocd-jurisdiction/country:us/state:de/government", "name": "Delaware", "classification": "state", "division_id": "ocd-division/country:us/state:de"}, "scraped_at": "2025-11-26T06:10:49+00:00", "_id": "a98722c2-ca8c-11f0-8677-32549feb6cd6"}
