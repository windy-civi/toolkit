It requires the Division of Public Health\u2019s Office of Healthcare Provider Resources to collaborate with the Delaware Health Care Commission and the Division of Professional Regulation to determine what data should be collected from health care providers during the licensing and renewal process to assist the Division of Public Health with workforce research and planning. This Act also directs the Division of Professional Regulation to collect health care workforce-related data during the licensing or renewal processes. The data collected will be for purpose of health care workforce research and planning and will not include personal information such as personal financial information. \r\n\r\nThe health care provider licensing process provides a rich opportunity for this State to obtain information it needs to ensure that its health care workforce is equipped to meet the needs of Delaware residents. Collecting data with the goal of informing health care workforce research and planning is a common practice nationwide, with at least 28 states collecting health care workforce data as part of the licensing process. Such data will fill crucial gaps in the Division of Public Health\u2019s ability to understand health care workforce needs and develop policies and programs aimed at meeting them. \r\n\r\nAs is currently the case, health care workforce data collected by the Division of Professional Regulation may only be used for official state business. This Act provides that official state business includes the following purposes specific to health care workforce research and planning:\r\n\r\n1. Identifying and tracking data related to Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs), Maternity Care Target Areas (MCTAs), and Medically Underserved Areas and Populations (MUA/Ps), and other initiatives identified by the United States Department of Health and Human Services.\r\n2. Health care workforce research and planning.\r\n3. Understanding issues related to supply, demand, distribution, and use of health care workers.\r\n4. Informing health care workforce policy.\r\n\r\nThis Act also makes technical corrections to conform existing law with the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "short title", "title": "Public Health/Collaboration/Professional Regulation/Data"}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced and Assigned to Health & Social Services Committee in Senate", "date": "2025-05-01", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["introduction", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Health & Social Services", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Reported Out of Committee (Health & Social Services) in Senate with 6 Favorable, 2 On Its Merits", "date": "2025-05-07", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage", "committee-passage-favorable"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Health & Social Services", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Passed By Senate.
