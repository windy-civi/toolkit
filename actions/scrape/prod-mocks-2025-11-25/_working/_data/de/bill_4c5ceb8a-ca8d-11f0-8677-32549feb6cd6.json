This Act changes how a period of time is calculated so that weekends and legal holidays are not counted if the period of time is 12 days or less. \r\n\r\nThis Act also requires that a landlord maintain all of the following:\r\n1. Bulkheads, streets, and other grounds to prevent the accumulation of standing water, as permitted by law.\r\n2. All utilities and services provided by the landlord up to the physical connection to the home.\r\n3. The root system, limbs, and trunk or stem of trees in common areas.\r\n\r\nThis Act also updates the required standards for tree care to the generally accepted industry standards for tree care, the ANSI A300 Tree Care standards, because the American Association of Nurserymen ceased to exist on January 1, 2014. The ANSI A300 Tree Care standards are voluntary industry consensus standards developed by the Tree Care Industry Association and written by the Accredited Standards Institute.\r\n\r\nThis Act also makes technical corrections to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "short title", "title": "Manufactured Homes/Code Updates"}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced and Assigned to Housing Committee in House", "date": "2025-03-06", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Housing", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Reported Out of Committee (Housing) in House with 7 On Its Merits", "date": "2025-03-25", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Housing", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Amendment HA 1 to HB 39 - Introduced and Placed With Bill", "date": "2025-04-15", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["amendment-introduction"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Amendment HA 1 to HB 39 - Passed In House by Voice Vote", "date": "2025-04-15", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["amendment-passage"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Passed By House.
