Autism Resources falls under the Department of Education, and changing this member to a representative of the Department lends more flexibility in selecting a member to represent the Department. This Act also removes the Delaware Family Voices member, because Delaware Family Voices now falls under the Parent Information Center, who already has representation on the ICA. In addition, under this Act the ICA or DNEA may make recommendations on the family and self-advocate ICA positions for consideration by the Governor.\r\n\r\nThis Act also updates the appointing authority for ICA members that represent non-governmental entities, because the power of appointment cannot be delegated to an entity which is not a part of the state government. See State ex rel. James v. Schorr, 65 A.2d 810, 812 (Del. 1948).\r\n\r\nThis Act also makes technical changes to make existing law conform with the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced and Assigned to Education Committee in House", "date": "2025-06-11", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Education", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Kimberly Williams", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Kimberly Williams\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Laura V.
