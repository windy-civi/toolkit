The Act provides that, for lease-purchase property offered online and available for online sale or sale by e-commerce, a lessor may satisfy the lessor's disclosure obligations under \u00a7 7606(c) by electronic disclosure. Similarly, for personal property, other than lease-purchase property, that is offered for lease-purchase by a lessor, the lessor must disclose electronically the cash price of the item and the amount of the lease payment and the total amount of lease payments necessary to acquire ownership. These disclosures must be made before any of the disclosures required by \u00a7 7603 of the Delaware Lease-Purchase Agreement Act. \r\nFinally, the Act makes technical corrections to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "short title", "title": "Delaware Lease-Purchase Agreement Act/Add/Lease-Purchase Property"}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced and Assigned to Banking, Business, Insurance & Technology Committee in Senate", "date": "2025-03-13", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["introduction", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Banking, Business, Insurance & Technology", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Reported Out of Committee (Banking, Business, Insurance & Technology) in Senate with 3 Favorable, 4 On Its Merits", "date": "2025-03-26", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage", "committee-passage-favorable"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Banking, Business, Insurance & Technology", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Passed By Senate.
