However, in certain years, for example, 2025, the statute calls for financial disclosures to be filed over the weekend, because March 15, 2025 fell on a Saturday.  On weekends, the assistance of the Public Integrity Commission may not be available. This Act changes the deadline for filing financial disclosures to \u201con or before the third Wednesday of March\u201d which will be a weekday and a regular business day. This Act also clarifies the statute by expressly stating that the financial disclosures may be filed \u201con or before\u201d the new deadline, in keeping with the current practice of the Public Integrity Commission."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "short title", "title": "Financial Disclosure/Deadline Change/Third Wednesday in March"}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced and Assigned to Elections & Government Affairs Committee in Senate", "date": "2025-05-22", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["introduction", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Elections & Government Affairs", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Reported Out of Committee (Elections & Government Affairs) in Senate with 2 Favorable, 4 On Its Merits", "date": "2025-06-11", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage", "committee-passage-favorable"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Elections & Government Affairs", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Passed By Senate.
