It makes violations of the chapter an unlawful practice enforceable by the Consumer Protection Unit of the Department of Justice. The Act creates the following requirements for the towing and storage of vehicles without the consent of the owner or operator: \r\nPhotographic evidence must be taken to document the unauthorized parking of a vehicle before it may be towed, and written authorization to tow a specific vehicle is required before the vehicle may be towed from a private parking area. \r\nTow companies and storage facilities must publicly display their rates. \r\nTowing and storage rates must be reasonable, with reasonableness calculated in relation to the fees imposed by the companies for consensual towing and storage or based on average rates in the county. \r\nA maximum total towing rate of $250 and daily storage rate of $50 is imposed. \r\nTow companies must decouple or drop vehicles that have not been removed from parking areas if the owner returns before removal. The drop fee may not be more than 50% of the tow fee. \r\nStorage facilities must be open or accessible to the public from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. five days a week, and tow companies must make reasonable accommodations to redeem vehicles after-hours. \r\nIndividuals must be allowed to retrieve at no cost during business hours personal belongings from vehicles held in storage.\r\nStorage facilities may charge a fee of up to $50 for after-hours access to or retrieval of a vehicle. \r\nTow companies and storage facilities must accept credit cards, or have an ATM available with a reasonable access or service fee.\r\nWhere a tow is completed in violation of the chapter, the owner or operator is entitled to both reimbursement of the tow and storage fees as well as damages incurred to retrieve an illegally towed vehicle. \r\nTow companies may not patrol for illegally parked cars, unless they have a contract to do so and comply with the requirements applicable to any other unauthorized towing of a vehicle. \r\nTow companies may not pay or give other benefits to obtain information about cars parked without authorization."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "short title", "title": "Towing of Vehicles/Without Consent of Owner"}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced and Assigned to Public Safety & Homeland Security Committee in House", "date": "2025-03-11", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Public Safety & Homeland Security", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Reported Out of Committee (Public Safety & Homeland Security) in House with 5 Favorable", "date": "2025-03-18", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage", "committee-passage-favorable"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Public Safety & Homeland Security", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Amendment HA 1 to HB 67 - Introduced and Placed With Bill", "date": "2025-03-26", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["amendment-introduction"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Amendment HA 1 to HB 67 - Stricken in House", "date": "2025-03-27", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Amendment HA 2 to HB 67 - Passed In House by Voice Vote", "date": "2025-03-27", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["amendment-passage"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Passed By House.
