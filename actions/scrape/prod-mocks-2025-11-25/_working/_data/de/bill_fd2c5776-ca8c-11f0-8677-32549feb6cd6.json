Private plan employers with fewer than 25 employees that voluntarily elect to provide coverage under the Chapter that is otherwise exempted due to the size of their companies will be subject to all of the provisions of the Chapter.\r\nThis Act establishes a Paid Leave Advisory Committee to review issues related to the implementation and administration of the Paid Family and Medical Leave Insurance Program and to review proposed statutory and regulatory amendments to the program.\r\n\r\nThis substitute differs from House Bill No. 128 as follows:\r\nThis substitute does not change the calculation of an application year or change the 24-month benefit period to a 12-month benefit period.\r\nThis substitute adds provisions for child support garnishment of PFMLA benefits.\r\nThis substitute prohibits the practice of requiring employees to use unused accrued paid time off before accessing PFMLA benefits.\r\nThis substitute allows the Paid Leave Advisory Committee to begin meeting once the Delaware LaborFirst system is functional and the steering committee has been dissolved.\r\nThis substitute specifies that family and medical leave benefits cannot be assigned and are exempt from the claims of creditors.\r\nThis substitute sets forth procedures for executing upon judgments for amounts due under Chapter 37 of Title 19 or other titles subject to this chapter."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "short title", "title": "Family and Medical Leave Insurance/Updates"}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "was introduced and adopted in lieu of HB 128", "date": "2025-06-20", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Passed By House.
