{"legislative_session": "153", "identifier": "SB 75", "title": "AN ACT TO AMEND TITLE 4 OF THE DELAWARE CODE RELATING TO LOCAL CONTROL OF RETAIL MARIJUANA STORES BY COUNTIES.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": [], "abstracts": [{"note": "synopsis", "abstract": "This Act limits the restrictions a county may impose on the operation of marijuana establishments as follows:\r\n\u2022\tRequires that a medical marijuana compassion center that was granted a conversion license for a retail marijuana store under \u00a7 1335B of Title 4 must be allowed to operate the retail marijuana store as a nonconforming use. \r\n\u2022\tProhibits the denial of a building permit to a licensee under \u00a7 1335B of Title 4 if the improvements comply with the physical requirements for property zoned for that use. The nonconforming use laws for each county, \u00a7 2610, \u00a7 4920, and \u00a7 6920 of Title 9 all prohibit structural alterations if a building is a nonconforming use but \u00a7 1335B(a)(1) requires that a conversion licensee continue to operate the location as a medical dispensing location. Thus, it is extremely likely that a compassion center with a conversion license for a retail marijuana store will need to make structural alterations to operate both as a medical dispensing location and as a retail marijuana store.\r\n\u2022\tRequires that a county must allow the minimum hours of operation for a retail marijuana store to be 9 a.m. until 9 p.m. on Mondays through Saturdays and noon until 8 p.m. on Sundays.\r\n\u2022\tIn areas zoned for agricultural or industrial use, indoor, fully enclosed cultivation facilities may not be prohibited.\r\n\u2022\tIn areas zoned for commercial or industrial use, retail marijuana stores may be prohibited from operating only within a \u00bd mile of another retail marijuana store and within 500 feet of a place of worship, school, licensed child care, residential treatment facility, park, or library. \r\n\r\nThe limits on county restrictions under this Act preempt and supersede all existing and future county ordinances or regulations regarding the operation of marijuana establishments.\r\n\r\nSection 2 makes corresponding changes to \u00a7 1351 of Title 4 so that section applies only to municipalities. This Act also makes technical changes to use consistent language in subsections (a) and (b) of \u00a7 1351 and \u00a7 1351A.
