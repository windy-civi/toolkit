All the members of the first American cabinet had Scottish ancestry. Delaware's first governor, John McKinly, was born in Northern Ireland of Scottish descent. Americans of Scottish descent have played a vibrant influential role in the development of this country. However, not until 1997 was this influence recognized by a single-year U.S. Senate. \r\n\r\nResolution that appeared in the Congressional Record of April 7, 1997. In 1998 National Tartan Day was officially recognized on a permanent basis when the U.S. Senate passed Senate Resolution 155 recognizing April 6th as National Tartan Day. This was followed by companion bill House Resolution 41, which was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on March 9, 2005. President George W. Bush signed a Presidential Proclamation on April 4, 2008 making April 6 National Tartan Day. In April of 2008, then Governor Minner issued a statement celebrating the accomplishments of Scots-Irish Americans in the First State as part of a Scots/Scots-Irish Heritage Month.\r\n\r\nApril 6 commemorates the signing of the Declaration of Arbroath in 1320, which asserted Scotland's sovereignty over English territorial claims, and which was a significant influence on the American Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nCanada has been celebrating \"National Tartan Day\" since 1993. The idea and motivation for creating a similar American holiday was provided by the Scottish Coalition, a group of national Scottish-American cultural organizations."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced in Senate", "date": "2025-04-08", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Passed By Senate.
