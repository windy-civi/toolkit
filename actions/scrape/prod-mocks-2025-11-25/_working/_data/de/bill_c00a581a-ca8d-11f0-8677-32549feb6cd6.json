{"legislative_session": "153", "identifier": "SB 180", "title": "AN ACT TO AMEND CHAPTER 25, TITLE 24 OF THE DELAWARE CODE RELATING TO THE BOARD OF PHARMACY.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": [], "abstracts": [{"note": "synopsis", "abstract": "The Board of Pharmacy (\u201cBoard\u201d) has worked for several years to amend Chapter 25, Title 24 of the Delaware Code to update the statute governing pharmacy licensure and practice in this State. The result of these efforts is this Act, which modernizes Chapter 25 to include a licensure system similar to those already in place in many other states, reflects current practices and standards, and clarifies the law. The Board\u2019s priority in amending Chapter 25 was to ensure competence and accountability of individuals, pharmacies, and other establishments regulated by the Board.\r\n\r\nThis Act expands and updates the definitions section to include terms related to current practice, such as \u201ccompounding\u201d and \u201coutsourcing facilities.\u201d  Board membership terms are increased:  Board members will be eligible to serve for a maximum of three consecutive, three-year terms.  The Board officers are identified as president and vice president.  Several sections are added to the Board\u2019s powers and duties, including the authority to promulgate a Code of Ethics.  \r\n\r\nThis Act amends the qualifications for licensure as a pharmacist to set forth clearly objective criteria.  With respect to licensure as a pharmacist by reciprocity, the \u201cgood standing\u201d requirement is clarified, and a criminal background check requirement is added.  The requirements for license renewal, reinstatement, and reactivation are amended to provide that, after a certain time period has expired, a licensee will be required to undergo a criminal background check and the licensee\u2019s disciplinary history will be reviewed.  \r\n\r\nThis Act revises the potential Grounds for Discipline of pharmacists to include violation of the Code of Ethics.  Available sanctions are broadened to include permanent revocation and potential administrative penalties not to exceed $10,000 for the first violation with further penalties optional for subsequent violations.  These changes will serve as a deterrent for licensee conduct posing a risk to the public health, safety, and welfare.\r\n  \r\nThis Act strikes the provision for \u201cCounseling of Pharmacists\u201d to align statutory language with actual practice.  Disciplinary matters are public and are addressed by the entire Board.  The requirements for prescription labeling, pharmacy closing, and prescription departments will be addressed in rules and regulations to allow for necessary revisions as practice standards evolve.  \r\n\r\nThis Act also revises the requirements for pharmacies and non-resident pharmacies in the interest of objectivity and consistency.  Grounds for discipline and available sanctions are expanded.  In particular, the Board will have the discretion to impose an administrative penalty not to exceed $250,000 for each violation with further penalties available for ongoing violations.  Further, with respect to non-resident pharmacies, the Board will also have the authority to impose administrative penalties, up to $10,000 per day, for the infraction of delivering drugs into Delaware without a license issued by the Board.\r\n\r\nThis Act adds a new section for licensure requirements for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, outsourcing facilities, medical gas distributors, and retail non-pharmacies.  Key personnel will be required to undergo criminal background checks.  Possible administrative penalties are revised significantly, from $50 per day, to a maximum of $250,000 for each violation with further penalties available for ongoing violations.  The option of this sanction will serve as a deterrent for wrongful conduct by establishments that are often delivering drugs from out-of-state into Delaware.\r\n\r\nThis Act also makes revisions to ensure that statutory provisions are consistent with other Title 24 professional licensing board practice acts.  Technical corrections serve to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual. This Act takes effect 1 year after enactment."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "short title", "title": "Board of Pharmacy/Modernize"}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced and Assigned to Health & Social Services Committee in Senate", "date": "2025-06-06", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["introduction", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Health & Social Services", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Amendment SA 1 to SB 180 - Introduced and Placed With Bill", "date": "2025-06-24", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["amendment-introduction"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Reported Out of Committee (Health & Social Services) in Senate with 4 Favorable, 1 On Its Merits", "date": "2025-06-25", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage", "committee-passage-favorable"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Health & Social Services", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Amendment SA 1 to SB 180 - Passed By Senate.
