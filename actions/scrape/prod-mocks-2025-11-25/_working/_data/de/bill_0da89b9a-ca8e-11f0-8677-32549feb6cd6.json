The statute is currently ambiguous with regard to who may file pursuant to Section 7703.  Section 7701(4) defines a \"Petitioner\" as a law enforcement officer or any person who would be qualified to file a Petition for Protection from Abuse.  Section 7702(a) provides that \"a petitioner may request relief under section 7703 (Emergency hearings) or Section 7704 (Nonemergency hearings).\" However, Section 7703 only addresses the process a law enforcement officer must follow to procure a Lethal Violence Protective Order (\"LVPO\") and fails to mention any other class of petitioner.  At the time of the passage of the LVPO statute, there was specific discussion and intention to prevent individuals from filing for emergencies in the Justice of the Peace Court for the same reason that citizen warrants are no longer accepted in that Court.  This conclusion is borne out by the fact that Section 7703 does not prescribe any procedure or burden of proof an individual would need to meet to prevail in an emergency petition for a LVPO.  As with Weapons Relinquishment Orders governed by Section 1448C of Title 11, this proposed bill requires requests for emergency relief to come through a law enforcement agency rather than directly from an individual member of the public.  The bill removes the confusion that exists with the current wording of the statute."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "short title", "title": "Justice of the Peace Court/Emergency Relief/Law Enforcement Officers/Clarify"}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced and Assigned to Judiciary Committee in Senate", "date": "2025-03-13", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["introduction", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Judiciary", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Reported Out of Committee (Judiciary) in Senate with 1 Favorable, 4 On Its Merits", "date": "2025-03-26", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage", "committee-passage-favorable"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Judiciary", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Passed By Senate.
