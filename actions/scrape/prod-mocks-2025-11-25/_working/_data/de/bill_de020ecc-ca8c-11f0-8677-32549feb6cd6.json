The Transportation Trust fund is the source of funding for the Department to perform all road and bridge improvements in the State. This Act assesses an additional registration fee on owners of electric motor vehicles, plug-in electric motor vehicles, non-plug-in electric motor vehicles, and other fuel motor vehicles to make up for the declining motor fuel tax revenue impacts on the Department, as well as the increased costs associated with these types of vehicles which are generally heavier than traditional passenger motor vehicles with increasing roadway impacts.\r\nThis Act further increases several revenue sources in the following ways: \r\n1) Assesses a one-time set up fee to a nonprofit organization to create a special license plate.\r\n2) Increases the fee for issuance and renewal of a driver\u2019s license from $40 to $50. \r\n3) Increases the fee for a sex offender registration license replacement from $5 to $10.\r\n4) Increases the issuance and renewal of a commercial driver\u2019s license from $48 to $55. \r\n5) Increases the fee for renewal of a non-commercial driver\u2019s license Class A or B from $40 to $50.\r\n6) Increases the fee for adding an endorsement to a commercial driver\u2019s license from $5 to $10. A $10 fee for removing a restriction on a commercial driver\u2019s license is now charged.\r\n7) Increases the fee for taxicab endorsement and renewal from $3.45 to $10.  \r\n8) Makes the fee for a duplicate identification card for a lost or destroyed identification card set at $20. \r\n9) Makes the fee for a replacement identification card due to name change  $10. \r\n10) Increases the fee for a dealership license from $100 and $50 for renewal.\r\n11) Increases the document from 4.25 % to 5.25%.  \r\nThe effective date for these increases is generally October 1, 2025 to allow time for computer reprogramming and effective implementation.\r\nThis Act also makes technical corrections to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "short title", "title": "EVs/TTF/Funding"}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced and Assigned to Transportation Committee in House", "date": "2025-05-15", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Transportation", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Reported Out of Committee (Transportation) in House with 6 Favorable", "date": "2025-05-20", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage", "committee-passage-favorable"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Transportation", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Amendment HA 1 to HB 164 - Introduced and Placed With Bill", "date": "2025-05-21", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["amendment-introduction"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Amendment HA 1 to HB 164 - Passed In House by Voice Vote", "date": "2025-06-12", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["amendment-passage"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Passed By House.
