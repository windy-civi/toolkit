The complete legislation is found at Title 16 of the Delaware Code, Chapter 48B, Sections 4801B through 4809B. Chapter 48B applied to settlements with entities, and did not apply to bankruptcies. This is because the bankruptcy process itself extinguishes claims and thus provides the necessary \u201cglobal peace\u201d for settling parties.  At the time SB 166 was passed, it was contemplated that, in the context of the Purdue Pharma bankruptcy, the Sackler family members would obtain this type of bankruptcy-style discharge and release. However, in the summer of 2024, the United States Supreme Court ruled that such a discharge was impermissible. This decision thus required that the states negotiate a non-bankruptcy settlement with the Sacklers, which the Delaware Department has since been pursuing diligently.  \r\n\r\nAs announced on January 23, 2025, the Delaware Department of Justice has reached a proposed settlement-in-principle with Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family.  In order to once again maximize the amount of Sackler money that Delaware will receive, it is now necessary to update the statutory bar created by the SB 166 to account for the fact that the Sackler family members are \u201cindividuals\u201d not \u201centities.\" Consequently, the Delaware Department of Justice is recommending the amendments to Chapter 48B of Title 16 reflected in this Act."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "short title", "title": "Prescription Opioid Impact Fund/Individuals/Entities"}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced and Assigned to Health & Social Services Committee in Senate", "date": "2025-05-07", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["introduction", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Health & Social Services", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Reported Out of Committee (Health & Social Services) in Senate with 8 Favorable", "date": "2025-05-14", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage", "committee-passage-favorable"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Health & Social Services", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Passed By Senate.
