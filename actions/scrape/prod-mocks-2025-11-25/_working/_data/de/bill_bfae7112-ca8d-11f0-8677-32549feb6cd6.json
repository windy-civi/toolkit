The Act requires a clear and conspicuous disclosure of fees and costs associated with the total cost of a ticket being provided to a purchaser before the purchaser\u2019s payment information is requested. The Act prohibits the reselling of a ticket until the event is placed on sale to the general public, including any tickets that may be obtained or accessed through a fan club. The Act sets forth requirements regarding transferability of tickets, refunding of tickets, and bans on the use of deceptive practices for any reselling of a ticket. \r\n\r\nThe Act prohibits use of a bot or other methods used to circumvent reasonable restrictions on the sale of tickets on the internet. The Act places a cap on prices in which a reseller can offer or sell a ticket at 10% of the total price of the initial ticket price. It also places a requirement upon any person who resells 100 or more tickets per year to register with the Division, excluding tickets that are bought for sporting events as part of a season ticket package. The Act requires registered resellers to provide certain identifying information and submit a report every two years summarizing the total tickets sold, the original purchase price of each ticket, and the final resale price. \r\n\r\nThe Act requires a surety bond requirement upon registered resellers to protect consumers in cases where the reseller fails to provide tickets.
