This Act expands the availability of free meals by making them available to all public school students attending schools participating in the federal School Breakfast Program or National School Lunch Program. This Act requires public schools participating in the School Breakfast Program to make available free breakfasts to all attending students, regardless of household income. This Act also requires public schools participating in the National School Lunch Program to make available free lunches to all attending students, regardless of household income. \r\n\r\nThis Act requires the Department of Education to reimburse schools for costs of eligible meals not reimbursed by the United States Department of Agriculture under the School Breakfast Program and National School Lunch Program. \r\n\r\nThis Act adds definitions for breakfast, lunch, and eligible meal. This Act also removes the provision about the requirement for meals to follow the meal pattern requirements under the School Breakfast Program and the National School Lunch Program because the definitions of breakfast and lunch now include that requirement by reference to federal law.\r\n\r\nThis Act takes effect 30 days following the date of publication in the Register of Regulations of a notice from the Controller General that funds have been appropriated to implement the provisions of this Act.\r\n\r\nThis Act also makes technical corrections to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced and Assigned to Education Committee in House", "date": "2025-03-11", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Education", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Stricken in House", "date": "2025-03-18", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Sherae'a Moore", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Sherae'a Moore\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Josue O Ortega", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Josue O Ortega\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "William Bush", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"William Bush\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Franklin D.
